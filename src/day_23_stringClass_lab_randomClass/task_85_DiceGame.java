		 * 
		 * -> Generate a random integer in the range of 1 thru 6. This is the value of
		 * the computer’s dice.
		 * 
		 * -> Generate another random integer in the range of 1 thru 6. This is the
		 * value of the user’s dice.
		 * 
		 * -> The dice with the highest value wins. (In case of a tie, there is no
		 * winner)
		 * 
		 * As the loop iterates , the program should keep count of the number of times
		 * the computer wins, and the number of times that the user wins. After the loop
		 * performs all of its iterations, the program should display who was the grand
		 * winner, the computer or the user.
