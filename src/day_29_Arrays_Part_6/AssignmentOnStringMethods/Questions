Question-2

Write a program that will calculate laptop price based on the components.

First, ask user for screen size. If screen size equals to 13.3, add $200 to the laptop price. If screen size equals to 15.0 - add $300 to the laptop price. If screen size equals to 17.3 - add $400 to the laptop price.

Then ask the user for CPU type. If CPU type equals to i3, add $150 to the laptop price. If CPU type equals to i5, add $250 to the laptop price. If CPU type equals to i7, add $350 to the laptop price.

Then ask the user for RAM size. Add $50 for every 4GB of ram to the laptop price.

Then, ask the user for the storage type. There are 2 options: SSD and HDD. If it's HDD - add $50 to the laptop price for every 500gb. If it's SSD - add $100 to the laptop price for every 500GB.

Then ask the user for screen resolution. There are 2 options: FULLHD and 4K. Add $100 if it's FULLHD screen and $200 if it's 4K screen.

Question-14

Write a program that will calculate car insurance premium.
Steps to write a program:
First things first, your program should ask the customer to provide a name, so display a message: "Enter your name".

Then ask the user about ownership of the US driver's license. Display message: "Do you have a US driver license?". If the user doesn't have a US driver's license - display warning message: "Invalid data!" and stop the program (use System.exit(0) after displaying warning message to stop the program).

Then ask the user to provide a zip code. If zip code equals to 20910 or 20740, add $60 to the premium (an amount to be paid for an insurance policy).
If zip code equals to 22102 or 22103, add $30 to the premium. Otherwise, add $50 to the premium.

Then ask the user about car ownership. Display message: "Is this vehicle Owned, Financed, or Leased?". If the car is owned, add $10 to the premium, otherwise, add $20 to the premium.

Then ask the user about car usage. Display message: "How is this vehicle primarily used?". If the car used for Business, add $50 to the premium. If the car is for pleasure add $10 to the premium. If the car is for Commute - add $20 to the premium.

Then ask the user how many days per week user drives to work. Display message: "Days Driven To Work And/Or School". Add $5 to the premium for every day driven to work.

Then, ask the user about how many miles customers drive to work or school. Display message: "Miles Driven To Work And/Or School". Increase premium per $1 for every 1 mile.

Then ask the customer about his age. Display message: "How old are you?". 
     If age is less than 16, display the message: "Invalid data!", and stop the program. 
     If age is between 16 and 18 (exclusive), multiply premium by 20. 
     If age is between 18 (inclusive) and 21 (inclusive), multiply premium by 6. 
     If age is between 21 (exclusive) and 25 (exclusive), multiply premium by 2.

Then, ask the customer about the driving experience. Make sure that experience is greater than 0 and the result of subtraction age from experience is greater or equals to 16. If no, display the message: "Invalid data!" and stop the program. Reduce premium on $5 for every year of experience.

Then, ask the customer about car accidents. Display message: "Have you had any accidents in the last 5 years?". If the answer equals "Yes" or "YES", ask customer about amount of accidents. Display message: "How many?", in order to get information about the amount of accidents. Add 20% to the premium price for every accident.

Then, ask the customer if he had continuous insurance for the past 12 months. Display message: "Have you had continuous insurance for the past 12 months?". If the customer provides a negative answer (No) - double the premium.

Then ask the user about the level of education. Display message: "What is the highest level of education you have completed?". 
     If the level of education equals to "Ph.D." or "Bachelors" or "Masters" - reduce the premium by 5%. 
     If the level of education equals "Doctors" reduce the premium by 10%. 
     If the level of education equals "Less than High School" increase the premium by 5%.

After all, display the message "customer, here's your quote!". Instead of the customer, you need to insert customers' name. The display message: "Start Your Policy Today For: $premium". Instead of premium, your program should print the premium's variable value. Then display the message with reference number: "Reference number: referenceNumber". In order to build reference number variable (referenceNumber), concatenate first 2 letters of customer's name, age, last 2 letters of customer's name, zip code, and level of education without spaces. This value should be all upper case!
