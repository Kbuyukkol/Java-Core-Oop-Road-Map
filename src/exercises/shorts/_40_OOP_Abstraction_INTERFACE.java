        INTERFACE:
            - It's a template, a blueprint of a class
            - Interface keyword is used to create interface
            - Specifies the behavior(s) that a class should implement
            - Provides additional methods that subclasses need
            - We can achieve 1005 abstraction using interfaces

        PROPERTIES OF INTERFACE
            - Variables are STATIC & FINAL by default
            - Interface can have: Only
                                1. STATIC methods,
                                2. Abstract methods
                                3. Default Methods

        WHAT INTERFACE CAN NOT HAVE?
            - Instance variable
            - Instance methods
            - Constructors
            - Blocks
            - We can not create objects from interface.

        IMPLEMENTING THE INTERFACE:
            - Class can implement multiple interface
            - "implements" keyword used to inherit from interface(s)
            - when a class implements multiple interfaces, it must implement (Override) all the abstract methods.

            Syntax:
                public class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 .....{

                }
