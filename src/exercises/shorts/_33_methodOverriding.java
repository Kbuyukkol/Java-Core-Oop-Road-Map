    /*
        METHOD OVERRIDING

        - Giving different implementations to the method
        - One method having multiple different implementations.
        - Overriding a method must take place in subclass.
        - Less memory usage and improves the usability of our code

        Rules of method overriding

        - Must happen in the subclass
        - Return type, method name and parameters of the overridden method must be same
        - Access modifiers of the overridden method needs to be same or more visible.
        - We can not override methods with private access modifier, or with static & final specifiers.
